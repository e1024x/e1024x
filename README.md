## Hey, I'm Aymen

I'm a master's student in Computer Science Engineering at UGent, mostly interested in cybersecurity and AI, but I like working on a variety of tech projects.  

Some projects I have been (or am) working on:  
- [2D_Game](https://github.com/e1024x/2D_Game) – a game with AI-driven dynamic difficulty
- [DroneDepthSense](https://github.com/e1024x/DroneDepthSense) – autonomous drone navigation with real-time 3D depth mapping  
- [robot-rl](https://github.com/e1024x/robot-rl) – reinforcement learning AI on microcontrollers  

I’m currently in the process of uploading more of my projects to GitHub. I also plan to publish writeups for CTFs I have participated in soon.  

Outside of tech, I like swimming and running. It helps me clear my head.
